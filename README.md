# Purposes of Interactive Quiz

Assessment: Quizzes are often used to assess a person's knowledge or understanding of a particular subject. They can help educators gauge how well students have grasped the material covered in class or provide employers with insights into the skills and knowledge of job candidates.

Learning Reinforcement: Quizzes can reinforce learning by providing an opportunity for students to recall and apply information they've learned. The act of retrieving information during a quiz can strengthen memory and understanding.

Engagement: Quizzes can be engaging and interactive, capturing the attention of participants and motivating them to actively participate in the learning process. They can be designed with elements of competition or gamification to make learning more enjoyable.

Feedback: Quizzes can provide valuable feedback to both learners and educators. Learners can assess their own understanding of the material based on their quiz scores and feedback on incorrect answers. Educators can use quiz results to identify areas where students may need additional support or to adjust teaching methods as needed.

Preparation: Quizzes can serve as a tool for preparation, helping students review material before exams or assessments. By practicing with quiz questions, students can identify areas where they need to focus their study efforts and gain confidence in their knowledge.
